# OfflineTP

OfflineTP is a Minecraft plugin that allow users to teleport to a player even when they are offline. 

For this to work it is required that your server is connected to a MySQL server, as that is where all the data is stored.

When a user logs on after being teleported, said user will be notified that they were moved as shown bellow
